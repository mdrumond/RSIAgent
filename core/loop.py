    resume handoff). ``initial_history`` + ``continue_context`` opt into a follow-up
    phase in the same Actor Agent conversation. ``allow_noop_done`` lets such a
    phase preserve the current state without forcing a meaningless program.
    ``terminal_handoff_ready`` is an optional transport-only callback: after a
    completed program action, a true value means the Agent has published its
    canonical terminal handoff and the attempt ends before another stochastic
    model call. It does not inspect task correctness. ``verifier_session`` carries
    one Verifier Agent while that Verifier identity is active; the resume controller
    reuses it for same-role resumes and supplies a distinct session after a Verifier
    model/config switch. ``program_executor`` optionally replaces only model-authored
    Program execution; it defaults to ``vm.run_script``. ``look_path_validator`` can
    reject model-selected Look targets before rendering, and ``look_fetcher`` can
    execute trusted rendering through a role-specific isolation boundary. It defaults
    to the normal VM renderer. All preserve every Actor call site when omitted.
    ``system_prompt`` and the three nudge overrides let a restricted role describe
    its real action contract without inheriting Actor-only Python/Bash instructions.
    ``user_message_transform`` can losslessly wrap every outgoing observation with
    that role's authoritative action reminder.
    ``instruction_is_complete_opening`` lets a restricted role supply its own
    complete first/recovery envelope without inheriting Actor-only PLAN/done
    language. It defaults off for every Actor call site.
    ``opening_image`` optionally reattaches an exact previously delivered visual
    observation to the first user turn of a recovered segment.  It is transport
    state, not a new observation, and defaults off for every ordinary Actor call.
    All of these default off, preserving existing call sites.
    ``turn_parser`` optionally replaces ``parse_turn`` for a domain integration.
    Parsed Program/Look/Ask/Done values retain their built-in behavior; any other
    non-None value is accepted only when ``action_executor`` is also supplied. The
    executor returns ``DomainActionResult`` and is responsible for enforcing and
    recording its restricted action vocabulary. Both hooks are inert by default.
    ``verifier_failure_router`` is an optional separated-authority callback used
    only after a concrete Verifier Agent FAIL. It receives the complete report and
    returns ``(REVISE|EVOLVE, complete Curriculum Agent report)``. With no callback,
    the historical same-Actor revision behavior is byte-identical.
    ``verifier_pass_router`` is the complementary unified-loop callback. It receives
    a complete Verifier PASS and returns ``(HANDOFF|VERIFY_MORE, complete Curriculum
    Agent report)``. VERIFY_MORE resumes the same Verifier Agent on the unchanged
    candidate; it never returns control to the Actor or changes machine state.

    because it lived inline in a VM-bound loop and nothing could test it).

    Role-relative swaps happen here, and the distinction is the whole point:
      * vision_model -> role-relative sight (v39 native-coherence): when a NATIVE
        primary escalates to a text model, the demoted primary becomes its eyes.
        In the reverse direction, when the delegated eye itself becomes Actor, it
        uses native vision instead of delegating a redundant call to itself.
      * verifier_model -> restored to cross-model (xverify): if the configured
        Verifier becomes the escalated Actor, move the original Actor model into
        the Verifier seat instead of allowing self-review.
      * agentic_verifier_config -> the escalation role's dedicated config when set.
        A caller must keep its conversation in a verifier-model-specific session.
      * sampling/provider routing -> escalation-specific values. Sampling points and
        provider constraints are model-specific; a Z.AI route must never follow a
        GLM Actor into a K3 request.

    What is NOT reset: reasoning_in_history. RIH is model-AGNOSTIC — decisive for
    BOTH (v38 K3 + GLM ladder 07-28; DECISIONS_LEDGER rule "rih: always"). The old
    code reset it to False on the pre-ladder belief that RIH was "k3's protocol",
    silently stripping it from every escalated GLM segment ( 08-12: "this is
    our bug"). It now inherits the base config's value."""

    discard the conversation, keep the machine, and start a fresh attempt on the

    newly activated cross-model Verifier without exposing that policy to ordinary
    benchmark runs.

    v18 (strategy-diverse restart): the handoff now branches on the mechanical
    file-delta taken at the stall exit. Delta EMPTY = the attempt provably banked
    nothing — the draw itself was the failure (strategy lottery), so the fresh
    attempt gets a self-post-mortem plus an explicit directive to take a materially
    different approach. Delta non-empty (or unknown) = work is banked — the proven
